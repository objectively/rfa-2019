    based on whether the examples met the requirements of the criteria question; were
    in effect in April 2018; were verifiable with publicly available information;
    and the extent to which the examples exhibited four characteristics: breadth,
    depth, legal framework, and interconnectedness. See Methodology (p. 14) section

      billion annually, through five components: an automatic tax return service,
      a new data warehouse and analytics tool that incorporated legacy tax data, a

      A [2014 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626) (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the [Self-Support Index](https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2016/other/160886.pdf) to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, whereas counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” \[[256J.626(7)(a)(2)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626)].

      A [2016 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&number=SF3481&session_year=2016&session_number=0) (section 14, line 15.21) allows savings from reducing sentences for minor drug offenders to be applied to evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for those in prison and under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ [own research](https://mn.gov/doc/data-publications/research/) which [found](https://mn.gov/doc/assets/03-10CDTXEvaluationReport_Revised_tcm1089-275973.pdf) (p. 26) that drug treatment reduces recidivism.

      100% of the state’s $8.5 million in federal Title I school improvement funds
      to districts and schools for interventions backed by strong, moderate, or promising
      evidence (using the top three tiers of evidence as [defined](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf#page=8)
      by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)). This represented an increase
      over the approximately 15% of funds that had been allocated based on level of
      evidence in the 2016-2017 school year. Grant recipients may set aside funds
      to monitor and evaluate the identified evidence-based approaches to ensure the
      investments yield a positive impact on student outcomes.\n\nBeginning in 2017,
      the Nevada Department of Education began requiring school districts to invest
      awarded funds for two additional federal grant programs in interventions that

      access to a well-rounded education),  where the stronger the evidence behind
      an application, the earlier it is considered for funding; (2) [ESSA Title IV-B](http://www.doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/nde.doe.nv.gov/content/Grants/2018RFA-21stCCLCCURRENT.pdf)
      ($9 million in 2017-2018), for the competitive 21st Century Community Learning
      Centers grants. \n\nStarting in 2013, the Nevada State Legislature passed a
      series of laws with strong evidence requirements that aligned state education
      funding with ESSA’s tiered evidence definition. The following six programs require
      grantees to use interventions that meet one of the four [ESSA evidence tiers](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf#page=8)

    long_description: "Since 2015, Rhode Island’s Department of Children, Youth, and
      Families has worked to [reform and restructure](https://govlab.hks.harvard.edu/rhode-island-department-children-youth-and-families-performance-improvement)
      the department’s procurement processes in four areas: improving service delivery
      through strategic planning, embedding results-driven procurement in new contracts,
      improving performance through active contract management practices, and supporting
      results-driven contracting practices through technical resources, tools, and
      processes for staff. As part of this initiative, the department executed $90
      million in 116 results-driven contracts that require providers to meet outcome
      goals rather than output metrics. As a result, DCYF has reduced the number of
      children in group care by over 20% since 2015, experienced a 50 percent expansion
      of foster care resources for the most challenging adolescents, doubled the capacity
      of high quality family visitation and reunification services, and made start-up
      investments of $1.2 million in nonprofit community organizations to support
      new and expanded programming.\n\nIn 2015, Rhode Island’s Department of Labor
      and Training launched Real Jobs Rhode Island, an innovative $14 million workforce
      program. To track the program’s success, Rhode Island [created](https://govlab.hks.harvard.edu/rhode-island-workforce-development)
      performance-based metrics and used frequent meetings with training providers
      to track results and make course corrections. As a result of this active contract
      management, Rhode Island was able to reconfigure the way it manages and [evaluates](http://www.dlt.ri.gov/realjobs/pdfs/ProgReportRJRI.pdf)
      its job training programs to capture meaningful long-term employment outcomes.
      The state also has created a Strategic Coaching Procurement Playbook, which
      includes [specific strategies](http://www.purchasing.ri.gov/StateAgencyInfoCenter/DocsForms/strategic-procurement-coaching-playbook.pdf#page=15)
      and [sample language](http://www.purchasing.ri.gov/StateAgencyInfoCenter/DocsForms/strategic-procurement-coaching-playbook.pdf#page=16)
      for using active contract management to get better results. "

      Providers that meet recidivism prevention goals receive a 1% increase in their
      rate while providers that fail to meet targets for two consecutive years can
      have their contracts terminated. Following the introduction of these performance
      goals, the program’s recidivism rate dropped by 11.3% in 2014, [another](https://www.nmlegis.gov/Entity/LFC/Documents/Program_Evaluation_Reports/Corrections%20Department%20-%20Status%20of%20Programs%20to%20Reduce%20Recidivism%20and%20Oversight%20of%20Medical%20Services.pdf#page=19)
